    "There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1.\n",
    "Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]\n",
    "Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "2, [[1,0]]\n",
    "There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.\n",
    "2, [[1,0],[0,1]]\n",
    "There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.\n",

    "This problem is equivalent to finding if a cycle exists in a directed graph. If a cycle exists, no topological ordering exists and therefore it will be impossible to take all courses.\n",
